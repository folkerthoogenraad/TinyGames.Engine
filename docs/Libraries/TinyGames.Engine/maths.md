# TinyGames.Engine - Maths
The maths part of this library is a great addition for anyone to make games. 
It contains two categories of objects: Math objects and helper objects.
 - `AABB`. An axis aligned bounding box
 - `Circle`. A circle representation.
 - `Line`. A circle representation.
 - `Polygon`. A circle representation.
 - `Triangle`. A circle representation.

And some helper classes:
 - `Vector2Extensions`. Extensions to the vector2 class.
 - `Tools`. Some general tools.
 - `Collsion`. Some collision calculating helpers.
